[How to Build Saas Applications](https://blog.postseam.com/tag/how-to-build-saas-applications/) series, we will be

This application will be used develop our SaaS application and will be extended to add new functionality. 

## Using the package.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
